# GRIPApril-Task1-Prediction-using-Supervised-ML
Predicting the percentage obtained by students based on the no. of hours they have studied.
The idea behind this project is to develop a simple and efficient algorithm to predict the scores obtained by a student based on the number of hours they put into studying.
The code works efficiently various parameters like Training, Testing and Predicting the values. 
The scatter plots and regression lines help in visualizing the data that is being calculated.
